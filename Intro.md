### What is HTML?
HTML is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content on a web page, such as text, images, links, and other multimedia. HTML uses tags to define the structure and elements of a web page.
### Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document starts with a specific structure that ensures it is recognized by web browsers:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
#### Breakdown of the Code:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as HTML5.
<html>: The root element that wraps all the content on the page.
<head>: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title, styles, and scripts.
<title>: Sets the title of the page (shown on the browser tab).
<body>: Contains the main content of the page, visible to users.
```
### Common HTML Tags
#### 1. Headings
```
Use <h1> to <h6> tags for headings, where <h1> is the largest and <h6> is the smallest.
```
##### Example:
```
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
```
#### 2. Paragraphs
```
Use <p> for paragraphs.
```
##### Example:
```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
